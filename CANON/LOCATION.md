**Type:** Backpacker / Adventure Hostel

**Price Range:** EUR 20-45 per night

### History
A converted farmhouse from the 1890s, turned into a hostel in 2015 by a Dublin entrepreneur who saw opportunity in cliff tourism. The property has been in the same family for generations. The sunrise tours started as informal guest activities and became the hostel's main attraction and liability.

### The Death Location (Specific)
The "secret" ledge is a grassy outcropping about a kilometer from the official viewing platform, accessible by a muddy path that the hostel's sunrise tours have worn into existence. No barriers, no official signage, just a grass-covered edge that drops 200 meters straight down. In the early morning light, it's difficult to see exactly where solid ground ends.

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Siobhan O'Brien
**Description:** 50s, local woman, has worked at the hostel since it opened. Warm but no-nonsense. Has seen too many close calls.
**Role in death:** Warned Valentina about the cliffs the night before. Will feel guilty. Will testify at the inquest.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Mary | Local grandmother, says rosary for every death |
| Security | None | Rural Ireland doesn't need it |
| Bar/Kitchen | Danny | Siobhan's nephew, does breakfast and packed lunches |
| Tour Guide | Sean Murphy | 30s, mountaineering experience, will be destroyed by this |

### Staff Knowledge
Everyone knows the dangers. Siobhan gives a speech to every guest about cliff safety. Sean has pulled people back from edges before. They all know it's a matter of time before someone dies on their watch. They're just hoping it's not today.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Quiet, recovery, planning. Guests nursing hangovers and planning hikes. Hot tea and rain checks.

### Night Vibe
Pub crawls in Doolin, traditional music sessions, early bedtimes before sunrise tours. Quieter than most hostels.

### Guest Demographics
70% American and European, 20% Australian, 10% various. Age range 25-45, skewing older than beach party hostels. Mix of photographers, hikers, and cultural tourists.

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- The Cliffs of Moher are genuinely dangerous; multiple deaths occur yearly
- "Secret" photo spots are widely shared online despite dangers
- Irish weather is genuinely unpredictable
- Rural Irish hospitality is real and warm

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Irish characters should be authentic, not leprechaun stereotypes
- Acknowledge complicated feelings about tourism
- Respect for the land vs. tourist disregard is a real tension

### Sources
- Cliffs of Moher official safety information
- News stories about selfie deaths at cliffs
- Irish hostel culture and Wild Atlantic Way tourism
- Photography forums discussing dangerous locations
